QUICK FIX FOR "No Object Binding specified" CAMERA ERROR
=============================================================

OPTION 1: Fix via Unreal Python Console (FASTEST)
--------------------------------------------------
1. In Unreal Editor, go to: Tools → Execute Python Script
2. Click "..." and select: C:\U\CinematicPipeline_Scripts\fix_camera_binding.py
3. Click "Execute"
4. Check Output Log - should see "SUCCESS: Camera binding fixed!"


OPTION 2: Recreate Sequence with Proper Binding
------------------------------------------------
1. In Unreal Editor, go to: Tools → Execute Python Script
2. Click "..." and select: C:\U\CinematicPipeline_Scripts\create_complete_cinematic.py
3. Click "Execute"
4. This will recreate the entire sequence with correct camera binding


WHAT CAUSES THIS ERROR?
-----------------------
The Camera Cut track needs a valid object binding to know which camera to use.
The binding must be properly assigned using:
    camera_binding_id.guid = camera_binding.get_id()

This is a common issue in Unreal Engine 5.7 and must be fixed from within
Unreal's Python environment (cannot be fixed via Remote Control API).


AFTER FIXING:
-------------
The remote playback script will work perfectly:
    python C:\U\CinematicPipeline_Scripts\external_control\test_sequence_playback.py
