# 400m Dash Choreography System Implementation

## Phase 1: Waypoint Chain API
- [x] Add speed/acceleration parameters to ActorBuilder methods
- [x] Implement basic 2D visualizer with Pygame
- [x] Create track renderer, runner renderer, simulation engine

## Phase 2: 400m Track Choreography
- [ ] Integrate visualizer with MovieBuilder API
- [ ] Create `race_400m.py` movie definition
- [ ] Define 6 runners with lane assignments
- [ ] Implement staggered starts for fair race
- [ ] Define track waypoints (straights + curves)

## Phase 3: Testing & Verification
- [ ] Test waypoint chaining in visualizer
- [ ] Test speed profiles
- [ ] Export to Unreal and run 400m race
- [ ] Verify lane merging and finish line
