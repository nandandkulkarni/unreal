  Creating marker: FocusTarget
    ✓ Marker created with /Engine/BasicShapes/Cylinder
  Creating camera: FrontCam
    → Camera rotation calculated to look at 'Runner1': <Struct 'Rotator' (0x0000014E87E1FBC0) {pitch: -0.381966, yaw: 179.904507, roll: 0.000000}>
    → Enabling LookAt tracking (post-binding)...
    ✓ Snapped initial rotation to Runner1 (<Struct 'Rotator' (0x0000014E87E1DC30) {pitch: -0.381966, yaw: 179.904507, roll: 0.000000}>)
    ✓ LookAt tracking enabled (interp_speed: 5.0)
